This man painted Medusas severed head on the concave surface of a ceremonial shield. In one of his
paintings, an old woman grips a cloth with both hands and stares fiercely at the title man, while the title girl
shrinks back. This man painted a self-portrait as a severed head held by his student Cecco, in
David with the Head of Goliath. This painters career only lasted about fifteen years, since he had to flee Rome in
1606 after killing a man in a fight. His heavy use of chiaroscuro was one of the formative forces in Baroque
painting. For 10 points, name this Italian painter of Judith Beheading Holofernes and The Calling of Saint Matthew.
