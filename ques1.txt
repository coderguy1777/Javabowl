In metals, this process only occurs in the absence of Langmuir waves below the plasma frequency. The
intensity of this process is given by the square of n- 1 minus n-2, over n-1 plus n-2, according to the Fresnel
equations. For a properly polarized input, this process does not occur at Brewsters angle. Light propagating
above the critical angle is transmitted in optical fibers via the total internal type of this process. After the
specular type of this process, the angle of the outgoing ray equals the angle of incidence. For 10 points, name this
optical process in which light bounces off of surfaces like mirrors
