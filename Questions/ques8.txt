A poet who wrote in this language, known for his Notebooks, began a twenty-year silence in 1898, and
wrote The wind rises We must try to live! in his The Cemetery By the Sea. A poem in this language
claims Nature is a temple where each living column, at times, gives forth vague words where Man
passes through forests of symbols. Edgar Allan Poe first became known in Europe through translations
into this language. An 1857 poetry collection in this language, including Correspondences, The Albatross,
and three poems named Spleen, kicked off Symbolism. For 10 points, name this language of Paul Valery and
Charles Baudelaire, who wrote Les Fleurs du Mal.
