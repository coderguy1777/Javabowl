According to this book, sight has become a central “mediator of pleasure” due to increasing prohibitions on the direct satisfaction of desires. This book discusses how competition between (*)\u003c/strong\u003e courtiers was expressed through modes of consumption that later entered into individual consciousness through “sociogenesis.” The field of “process sociology” was largely inspired by this book’s analysis of “figurations,” or networks of people.

This artist was told to “learn to say ‘fuck you’ to the world once in a while,” and “Stop it and just DO!” in a lengthy letter from Sol LeWitt. This sculptor achieved a breakthrough by hanging a long loop of steel tube from the frame of a white canvas, and later made a series of open-top steel boxes whose insides bristle with rubber medical tubes.

This character listens to an offscreen neighbor lament her impulsive decision to follow the example of the person in front of her in line at the butcher’s and buy a large amount of veal. This character goes to several shops in a fruitless hunt to replace a button on a coat sent from Canada by her sister Fernande, and helps another character memorize Charles Baudelaire’s “The Enemy.” A rolling\u003c/strong\u003e (*) neon light from outside is visible in shots of this character’s dining room table, where she repeatedly deposits money into a soup tureen. After she burns a pot of potatoes, this character’s daily routine breaks down in the hours before a sexual encounter in which she has an unexpected orgasm and fatally stabs her client with a pair of scissors. For 10 points, name this resident of an apartment at “23 quai du commerce, 1080 Brussels,” the title character of a 1975 film by Chantal Akerman.",

St John the Wonderworker was part of a community that was evacuated from this city to the island of Tubabao; that émigré community of White Russians supplied many of the “taxi-dancers” that worked this city’s cabarets. Stirling Fessenden served as a powerful chairman of a Municipal Council in this city, where his police force’s shooting of protesters sparked the (*)\u003c/strong\u003e May 30th movement. A 1927 purge of Communist union workers in this city was carried out with the help of the Green Gang, whose opium smuggling contributed to this city’s reputation as a vice capital. This city’s French Concession was administered separately from its International Settlement, which was located in the Bund district.

In the paper establishing the nomenclature for these proteins’ intermediates, Lozier et al. reported that one of them shuttled between K590 to L550 to M412. Mutating one of these proteins at C128 or D156 generates a so-called “step function” variant that has a time constant on the order of seconds, instead of milliseconds. One of these proteins is linked via a Schiff base on the lysine-214 residue on its G (*)\u003c/strong\u003e helix to a molecule that isomerizes from all-trans to 13-cis. In 2004, Peter Hegemann isolated the Chr-1 and Chr-2 proteins of this type from the model green algae \u003cem\u003eChlamydomonas reinhardtii\u003c/em\u003e, kickstarting the field of optogenetics.

In an early scene in the work in which she appears, the protagonist hears this character weeping through a wall, and wonders why she doesn't come out of her room. The last sentence of a novella describes this character springing to her feet and stretching her young body after a journey on an electric tram. In one scene, this character needs to cover her hands with a rag while carrying out an (*)\u003c/strong\u003e unconsumed bowl of milk and bread, and replacing it with a selection of old vegetables, bones, and cheese.

In a commentary on a book inspired by this philosopher, Norman Kemp-Smith mistakenly claimed that quotations from this philosopher were available in James (*)\u003c/strong\u003e Beattie’s \u003cem\u003eEssay on Truth\u003c/em\u003e, which is largely devoted to attacking this man. An essay by this philosopher suggests that one must imagine oneself “as a man in general” to put aside “prejudices” when hearing a friend declaim. Although he is not Adam Smith, Frances Hutcheson’s influence appears in this man’s application of the concepts of “approbation” and “disapprobation” to art.

Book III of \u003cem\u003ede Anima\u003c/em\u003e mentions this concept in the context of conflict between wish and appetite during a larger discussion of how living things move. This state is placed alongside “vice” and “brutishness” as one of the three moral states to be avoided in a section of a work that claims this state is observable, but only in people who are not (*)\u003c/strong\u003e temperate. This state is said to be for the soul what paralysis is for the body in the \u003cem\u003eNicomachean Ethics\u003c/em\u003e, whose seventh book examines this state’s relation to ignorance. This state is contrasted with \u003cem\u003eenkrateia\u003c/em\u003e or “continence.” In the \u003cem\u003eProtagoras\u003c/em\u003e, Plato denies the possibility of this state by having Socrates claim that “no one willingly goes after evil.” For 10 points give this Greek term for when one allows \u003cem\u003epathos\u003c/em\u003e to overrule reason, sometimes called weakness of the will.",
