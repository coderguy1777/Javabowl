A form of the distribution coefficient used in this technique is KAV (“K-sub-A-V”) whose value is calculated from total volume, void volume, and elution volume. Dextrin-based Sephadex resins are commonly used in this technique, whose principles can be explained by either a steric or secondary mechanism. The “absolute” form of this technique combines it with dynamic light scattering. Polystyrene was originally used for this technique due to easily controlled pore size.

This event is attributed to cooling of the mantle and subsequent decrease in the availability of nickel-rich rock in the “nickel famine” theory. A spike in chromium rock deposits dating to this event suggests that a large increase in global levels of sulfuric acid occurred alongside it. This event likely caused the Huronian glaciation, which led to the first of many snowball Earths, as a result of the decrease in atmospheric methane.

Operation Fire Magic successfully freed 86 hostages in Mogadishu that were used as bargaining chips in exchange for the release of members of this group. With the aid of the PFLP, this group hijacked Lufthansa flight 181, and after the failure of that operation, some of its members executed industrialist Hanns Martin Schleyer. This group’s members Gudrun Ensslin and Jan-Carl Raspe died under suspicious circumstances in Stammheim prison during the 1977 “German Autumn.” For 10 points, what German left-wing terrorist group is sometimes known as the “gang” of its two founders?",

The MIDA ligand is used as a protecting group for these compounds by rehybridizing their centers from sp2 to sp3 (\"s-p-two to s-p-three\"). One of these compounds reacts with an amine and an aldehyde to perform a Mannich-like reaction named for Petasis. One of these functional groups replaces a leucine’s carboxyl group in the structure of the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib. Dehydrating these compounds causes them to trimerize into a compound containing a planar six-membered ring. In an undesirable side reaction, this functionality is protonated and cleaved, yielding its alkyl or aryl group, which occurs in coupling reactions such as the Chan-Lam or Suzuki reaction. These compounds are typically prepared by reacting a Grignard reagent with a borate ester. For 10 points name these organoborane compounds containing a boron bonded to an alkyl or aryl group and two hydroxyl groups.",

A gene in the sonic hedgehog pathway first discovered in this organism is commonly used to study the developing limb bud and is called talpid3 (tal-pid-three). Harrison’s axolotl staging model was used to develop a 46-stage model of this organism’s development by Hamburger and Hamilton. This organism is the most common source of IgY (\"I-G-Y\") antibodies. Studying this organism led scientists to discover that T and B lymphocytes were distinct cell types. The first oncovirus, which was discovered by studying this organism, has a mechanism later shown to be caused by the Src (“sarc”) gene. The bursa of Fabricius was discovered to produce antibodies in this model organism. For 10 points, \u003cem\u003eGallus gallus\u003c/em\u003e is the scientific name of which domesticated bird?",

This discipline is represented by an old woman with a knife who serves as a bridesmaid in an allegory written around the time of the AD 410 sack of Rome. In the late 13th century, the University of Paris was home to a group of philosophers called the Modists who posited that this discipline was vital to the study of metaphysics. The first popular teacher of this discipline in Rome was Saevius Nicanor according to the opening section of Suetonius’s \u003cem\u003eOn Famous Men\u003c/em\u003e, which is about its practitioners. Apollonius Dyscolus was called the prince of this study in a monumental work titled for the “Institutes” of this discipline written by Priscian, which was the primary textbook used to teach Latin throughout the Middle Ages. Along with logic and rhetoric, this discipline was part of the trivium. For 10 points, name this subject, the set of structural rules that govern the composition of language.",

A poem by this woman asks, “Do you see? / we were made fools of,” and closes by wondering, “How can I rest? / how can I be content / when there is still / that odor in the world?” In that poem, this author wrote of the title flowers, “I hate them. / I hate them as I hate sex.” \u003cem\u003eAverno\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eThe Wild Iris\u003c/em\u003e are collections by, for 10 points, what American poet who wrote “Mock Orange” and served as Poet Laureate in 2003?",

A film set in this country opens with abstract circular shapes that eventually reveal a human eye as a female voice speaks random syllables that gradually form words.

The antidiarrheals eluxadoline and loperamide bind to receptors for these compounds. These compounds are the most common identified by a mixture of sulfuric acid and molybdic acid called the Froehde reagent. Prolonged exposure to this class of compounds can result in hyperalgesia. Enkephalin and nociceptin are endogenous examples of these compounds. These compounds bind to a class of G protein–coupled receptors with mu, kappa, and delta varieties. The effects of these compounds are blocked by naloxone and naltrexone. The binding of these compounds to their mu receptors is believed to prevent nociceptive neurons from releasing substance P, causing analgesic effects. For 10 points, methadone and codeine are examples of what type of compound that acts on the same receptors as morphine?",

    "text": "The five unifying motifs in a song cycle by this composer include an agitated theme that first appears when the singer describes quails singing out in the morning and a so-called “Carlovengian” theme linked to the name of a poet’s love interest. The memory of far-off bells in the town of Cadirac inspired the slow movement of this composer’s second piano quartet in G minor, while his first piano quartet is in C minor.

Those twin brothers, who were conceived when their mother ate the heart of a sea dragon to become fertile, appear in one of three stories from this country adapted into the film \u003cem\u003eTale of Tales\u003c/em\u003e. In a fourth folktale from this country, a prince seeking a wife as “white as milk and red as blood” is told to open three oranges, each of which reveals a woman who will die immediately unless she gets water. For 10 points, what country’s folktales have been collected by Giambattista Basile (bah-SEE-lay) and Italo Calvino?",

A set of eight principles for governing this scenario include ensuring that those affected by the rules can participate in modifying them and using graduated sanctions for violators; those principles were put forth in a 1990 book about “governing” this situation that contrasts the Leviathan approach and the privatization approach.

This woman wrote about dealing patiently with “a terror” named Mr. O’Connell, who stayed for over a decade at a farm in Easton, Pennsylvania. After returning from Europe, she wrote a novel based largely on her own life in Greenwich Village that described the abortion she had after getting pregnant by Lionel Moise; that novel was published as \u003cem\u003eThe Eleventh Virgin\u003c/em\u003e. Her relationship with anarchist Forster Batterham fell apart after her religious conversion. The St. Joseph’s House was the first of around 30 hospitality houses established by this woman, who founded a paper that still sells for one cent per copy and shares it name with the movement she cofounded. In the 1930s, she met a Frenchman who advocated a “green revolution” of communal farming and was named Peter Maurin. For 10 points, name this journalist who founded the Catholic Worker movement.",

A chapter praising these things imagines a young lady saying “with affected indifference,” “Oh, it is only [one of these things],” which the narrator rephrases as, “It is . . . in short, only some work in which the greatest powers of the mind are displayed.” A defense of these things occupies chapter five of a book, in which \u003cem\u003eOrphan of the Rhine\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eNecromancer\u003c/em\u003e, and other “horrid” works of this form are introduced to the protagonist by Isabella Thorpe.

Different types of this property lend their names to a “cloud,” “sequence,” and “valley” on a diagram of galaxies that plots this property against luminosity or absolute magnitude. The Johnson-Morgan system is commonly used to quantify this property, which can replace the spectral class on one of the \u003cem\u003ex\u003c/em\u003e-axes of the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. This property can be quantified by subtracting the magnitudes of an object viewed under two different filters, which gives this property’s namesake “index.” For 10 points, name this property of astronomical objects that expresses their brightness in different regions of the visible spectrum.",
