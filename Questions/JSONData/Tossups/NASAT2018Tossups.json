This set of initiatives targeted the elite “Thousand Families” and included the nationalization of forests and a proposal for worker profit-sharing. This initiative broke up the “vaqf” system and created 2.5 million new landowners and a very popular Literacy Corps. The 15 Khordad protests opposed this set of initiatives, and an attempt to suppress criticism of this program led to the storming of the Fayẕiyyeh Madrasah in Qom and the development of the “velāyat-e faqīh” doctrine. The women’s rights and secularization portions of this initiative were strongly opposed by the ayatollahs. For 10 points, name this 1963 program launched by Mohammad Reza Pahlavi to modernize Iran.",

A text by this author of \u003cem\u003eCur Deus Homo\u003c/em\u003e refutes the “fool of Psalms” by distinguishing between the understanding and reality and uses an argument later refuted by Gaunilo that posits the existence of an imaginary island.

Two long suspension bridges over a channel called “the shoots,” one of them using the “English Stones” as a foundation, constitute this river’s eponymous “crossing” near its mouth. This river has been long discussed as the site of a possible power-generating barrage, due to its massive 46-foot tidal range that produces a recurring bore, a standing wave that surfers ride upriver. It rises at Wales’s highest point, and the River Wye and the Warwickshire Avon flow into this river, which drains into the Bristol Channel. For 10 points, name this river in West England whose enormous estuary sits between south Wales and Somerset.",

The movement Love Both opposed the campaign to perform this action, which was spurred by the inconsistent application of the X Case ruling and the 2012 death of Savita Halappanavar. This action undid the 1983 passage of the Eighth Amendment, which was created in the wake of a visit by John Paul II. The hashtag “#HomeToVote” was used by people travelling to participate in this action, which was advocated by Leo Varadkar, the incumbent Taoiseach (TEE-shuck).

In that story from this book, Reverend Hartmann shows a newspaper employee his bleeding fist with which he had punched a window with “the strength of god” after seeing a naked Kate Swift praying. In another story, Swift falls in love with her former pupil George Willard, who is told many stories working for title town’s newspaper in this book.

This material was used to create a set of up to a thousand statues that the king was ritually prohibited from viewing, and which usually held a knife in the lap, generally ranging from one to two feet tall; those figurines made from this material were likely manufactured by the Oba kingdom and were found, mostly defaced, in the Yoruba (YOH-roo-bah) town of Esie (ay-SEE-eh).

The third volume of a book by Athanasius Kircher partially titled for Oedipus is a guide to doing this action, which he based in part on his knowledge of Coptic. Polymath Thomas Young made a major advance in attempts to do this by positing that the text inside a cartouche (kar-TOOSH) could be the name of an important person.

Longer forms of these molecules are cut by Dicer to yield their small interfering type, which gets incorporated into the RISC in a namesake silencing process discovered by Fire and Mello.
