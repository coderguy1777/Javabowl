An integer \u003cem\u003en\u003c/em\u003e is this type of number if and only if \u003cem\u003e8 n plus 1\u003c/em\u003e is a perfect square. Ramanujan-Nagell numbers are simultaneously Mersenne primes and these numbers, and setting \u003cem\u003ep equals 1\u003c/em\u003e in Faulbaher’s formula gives these numbers. Gauss’s “Eureka theorem” states that every positive integer can be expressed as the sum of (*)\u003c/strong\u003e 3 of these numbers, and the \u003cem\u003enth\u003c/em\u003e one of these numbers is equal to the number of edges in the graph \u003cem\u003eK sub n\u003c/em\u003e. Subtracting two consecutive ones yields a trapezoidal number, while summing two consecutive ones yields a perfect square. In an n-team round robin, the “\u003cem\u003en-1”th\u003c/em\u003e number of this type will be the number of rounds, and the \u003cem\u003enth\u003c/em\u003e one of these numbers equals \u003cem\u003en times the quantity n+1 over 2\u003c/em\u003e.
