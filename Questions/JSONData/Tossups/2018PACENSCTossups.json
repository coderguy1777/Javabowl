The second book of a work by this mathematician consists of a classification of algebraic curves, including his namesake \"folium.\" This man is the inventor, and sometimes the namesake, of the field of analytic geometry. This man's three (*)\u003c/strong\u003e \"laws of nature\" were a major influence on Isaac Newton's laws of motion. An upper limit on the number of positive roots of a polynomial can be found using this mathematician's \"rule of signs.\" In two dimensions, ordered pairs are used to represent the \u003cem\u003ex\u003c/em\u003e- and \u003cem\u003ey\u003c/em\u003e-coordinates of numbers in his namesake coordinate system. For 10 points, name this French mathematician, who, in a famous work of philosophy, stated \"Cogito ergo sum.\"",
