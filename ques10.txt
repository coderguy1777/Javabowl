During a quest for this item, a gods burning eyes and voracious appetite are explained as a result of not
having slept or eaten for eight days. The Finnish god Ukko has an item analogous to this one thats called
Ukonvasara. This item is used daily to revive a pair of animals whose names translate as teeth grinder and
teeth barer. A gadfly bit Brokkr on the eye while he was making this object in a contest against the Sons of
Ivaldi, so its handle is too short. This object was once stolen by the giant Thrymr, and a special belt and pair of
gloves are required to wield this weapon. For 10 points, name this hammer wielded by Thor.
